A Loop executes the sequence of statements many times until the stated condition becomes false. 
A loop consists of two parts, a body of a loop and a control statement. The control statement is a combination of 
some conditions that direct the body of the loop to execute un til the specified condition becomes false. 
The purpose of the loop is to repeat the same code a number of times. 


Types  of Loops in C: 

Depending upon the position of a control statement in a program, looping in C is classified  into two types: 
1. Entry controlled loop 
2. Exit controlled loop

1. ENTRY CONTROLLED LOOP
In an entry controlled loop, a condition is checked before executing the body of a loop. 
It is also called as a pre-checking loop. 

2. EXIT CONTROLLED LOOP
In an exit controlled loop, a condition is checked after executing the body of a loop. 
It is also called  as a post-checking loop. 

The control conditions must be well defined and specified otherwise the loop will execute an infinite number of times. 
The loop that does not stop executing and processes the statements number of times is called as an infinite loop. 

An infinite loop is also called as an "Endless loop." Following are some characteristics of an infinite loop:
1. No termination condition is specified. 
2. The specified conditions never meet. 
The specified condition determines whether to execute the loop body or not. 

'C' programming language provides us with three types of loop constructs: 
1. The while loop 
2. The do-while loop 
3. The for loop
